Due to system updates on Mac with El Capitan, setting up Molly involves slightly more steps than usual. These are as below:

1.  Install sbt and graphviz

2.  If installed, uninstall apr and apr-util

3.  Download apr and apr-util from source and install as per instructions

4.  Run make in the highest level directory of the cloned repository

5.  c4 and z3 libraries now build

6.  Since environment variables are disabled for system security reasons, create symlinks in the working directory, like so:

    ln -s ./lib/c4/build/src/libc4/libc4.dylib ./libc4.dylib
    
    ln -s ./lib/z3/build/z3-dist/lib/libz3.dylib ./libz3.dylib

7. We are now good to go!!
